# Spam Email Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a spam email detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used for this project contains emails labeled as spam or ham (non-spam), and we will utilize machine learning classification algorithms to classify emails correctly.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Spam/Ham Email Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/spamham-email-classification-nlp)

## Frameworks and Libraries

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- TensorFlow
- NLTK

## Techniques Used

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Tokenization
   - Text cleaning (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
   - Vectorization (converting text data to numerical data)

2. Data Visualization:
   - Visualization of class distribution (spam vs. ham)
   - Word cloud visualization for most frequent words in spam and ham emails

3. Classification:
   - Training logistic regression model using processed text data
   - Evaluating model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
